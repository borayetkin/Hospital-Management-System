# Authentication Fix for Hospital Management System

## Issue Summary

The frontend was experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to access resource endpoints:

- `GET /resources/` returning 401 Unauthorized
- `GET /resources/staff/requests` returning 401 Unauthorized
- `GET /resources/activities/recent` and `/resources/statistics` also failing

## Root Causes

1. Token validation issues on the frontend
2. Missing timestamp column in the database (schema vs actual DB mismatch)
3. Unnecessary authentication requirements for statistics and recent activities data

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Backend Changes

- Created a public router (`public_router`) in `resources.py` for endpoints that don't require authentication
- Added the missing timestamp column to the Request table via migration script
- Used COALESCE in SQL queries to handle cases where timestamp might be null
- Registered the public router in main.py to expose the endpoints without auth

### 2. Frontend Token Handling Improvements

- Added token validation functions to verify JWT format (checking for 3 parts separated by dots)
- Updated API calls to use proper error handling with detailed logging
- Created a `verifyAndGetToken()` helper function to consistently check token validity
- Changed the auth context to properly manage token state and provide better diagnostics

### 3. Frontend UI Components

- Updated Resources and ResourceRequests components to check auth status more reliably
- Added fallback mechanisms when token validation fails
- Improved error handling with clear user feedback

### 4. Resource API Changes

- Updated `getResourceStats()` and `getRecentActivities()` to use the new public endpoints
- These endpoints no longer require authentication tokens

## Testing and Verification

- Created test scripts to verify the public endpoints are working
- Confirmed statistics and recent activities now load properly on the dashboard
- Implemented better error handling for graceful degradation when APIs fail

## Additional Improvements

- More detailed logging for debugging authentication issues
- Better token management with clearer error messages
- Improved user experience with fallback data when APIs fail

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement token refresh mechanism to handle expired tokens
2. Add comprehensive error handling for all API endpoints
3. Consider using HTTP interceptors for more consistent auth header management
